## Story

Oh no! It seems you've died an unfortunate death after getting run over by a car ðŸ˜¢But, luckily for you, you're reincarnated as a car ðŸ˜€!  Get your revenge by running over the next fool you see ðŸ˜ˆ

## Objective
The objective of the game is to run over your target. The arrow above your car will point you in the direction of the target Run over the target and you win! (it's just that ez) There's a drift meter in the top right of the screen which slowly decreases over time. The drift meter also decreases when you collide with another car You can keep your drift meter filled by drifting at top speeds (it won't fill if you drive too slow) If the drift meter reaches 0 you lose
